# Star Wars Character Viewer
*(Lifeway Corinth Code Challenge)*  

## Notes
* Many human characters are not listed as human. This is due to a swapi.dev bug referenced [here](https://github.com/Juriy/swapi/issues/5#issuecomment-1036982287).

## TODO
* on form submit, choose the first character in options
* clear search bar after selection
* header (title)
* footer (name, date, repo url)
* search bar ("Search for a character", search bar, search button)
* cards for starships/films?
* docker
